Got lots of information about how to develop linkedin profile.  
About the size of the connection I need, and how I should be presenting my work.  
I realized how much I could improve my exposure to the recruiters, and thought how much I could be trying harder.  
Got to talk to an old friend who I recently got in touch.  
Learned a lot about how people around me has been progressing and got lots of encouragement to keep trying.  
Also got offer to be referred to his company, which sounded great.  
I will definately keep him posted and try my best to be prepared.
