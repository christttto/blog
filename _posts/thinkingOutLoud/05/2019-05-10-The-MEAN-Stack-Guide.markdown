## Section  
### 1 Introduction  
### 2 What is Mean  
Browser code can easily be hacked or changed.  
It is way too complex, will make it slower.  
Hence, Node.  
  
Express is the framework for Node.  
Like Angular is framework for JS.  
  

#### What is Angular  
A client-Side(Browser) Framework which allows you to build Single-Page-Applications(SPA)  
It means that it will handle entire front end logic.  

Render UI with Dynamic Data.  
	It updates the UI whenever data updates.  
Handle User Input.  
	Validating the input, sending it to the server.  
Communicate with Backend Services  
Provides a "Mobile App"-like User Experience  
	Instead of refreshing the entire page, it changes only the parts of a page.  
  
#### What is Node  
A Server-side Library: JavaScript on the Server-side  
  
Listen to Requests and Send Responses  
  
Execute Server-side Logic  
  
Interact with Databases and Files  
  
An Alternative to PHP, Ruby on Rails, Java etc. It is rarely used Standalone!  
  
#### What is Express  
A Node Framework which simplifies writing Server-side Code and Logic.  
  
Based on Node, offers same Functionalities  
  
Middleware-based: Funnel Requests through Functions  
  
Includes Routing, View-rendering & More.  
  
Simplifies the Usage of Node. Express is for Node what Laravel would be for PHP.  
  
#### MongoDB  
A NoSQL Database which stores "Documents" in "Collections" (instead of "Records" in "Tables" as in SQL).  
  
Store Application Data (Users, Products, ...)  
  
Enforces no Data Schema or Relations  
  
Easily connected to Node/ Express (NOT to Angular!)  
A powerful Database which can easily be integrated into a Node/ Express Environment.  
  
  

### 3 What is a Single Page Application (SPA)  
  
In Angular, we will have root index.html page, and it will include script input for angular application.  
	This is to re-render.  
This allows for instant re-rendering, instant user feedback and makes building highly engaging UIs possible.  
  
### 4 How does the MEAN Stack work?  
  
Client side VS Server  
Angular  
	Presentation/ UI  
	Single-Page-Application  
		Does not have to be served by Node Backend.  
  
Node Express MongoDB  
	Business Logic (not shown to client)  
	Persistent Data Storage  
	Authentification  
  
  
Ajax handles requests and responses between the two sides.  
  
front end receives JSON format for data.
