Bought course on Udemy for MEAN Stack.  
The course has 13 sections, so in span of 3 weeks, I want to finish the whole thing.  
For next three weeks, this will be my priority in terms of studying.  
I want to finish half in week 1, second in week2, use week3 for potential delay so I absolutely finish the course without excuse.  
Week 1, I will finish up to section 6.  
Week 2, I will finish up to section 13.
