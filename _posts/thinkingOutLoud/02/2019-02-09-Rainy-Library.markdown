Another day at the library.  
Nothing fancy really.  
Replied to some emails, got to continue studying react.  
Right now, got up to 33.  
Which is a huge step for me today.  
Trying acutally stopwatching how long I actually focus and study, not get distracted.  
I hoped to reach up to 8 hours today, but reality is I got barely 2 hours in so far, of about 6 hours I have been at the library.  
  

It is better that I am becoming aware.  
It is better that I am studying.  
But, I have to be even better.  
Get closer to more efficient work.  
  
Second thought, I might have done too much of react for a day, without much time for it to sink down.  
Options to do other studying.  
  1. portfolio
  2. leetcode
  3. application

So, ended up working more with leetcode.  
It was definately less sleepy.  
But I might be at point where I am too drained to be getting new material down.  
Aim for tomorrow is to get the Todo application project on react finished, even that requires re-watching about 3 steps behind how far I watched.  
With 15 minutes left before library closes, I will just solve mind your decision problems.  
Too drained I want to say.  
  
Today I have been productive for 3:33
