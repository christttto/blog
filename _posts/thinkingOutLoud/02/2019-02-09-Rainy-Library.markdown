Another day at the library.  
Nothing fancy really.  
Replied to some emails, got to continue studying react.  
Right now, got up to 33.  
Which is a huge step for me today.  
Trying acutally stopwatching how long I actually focus and study, not get distracted.  
I hoped to reach up to 8 hours today, but reality is I got barely 2 hours in so far, of about 6 hours I have been at the library.  
  

It is better that I am becoming aware.  
It is better that I am studying.  
But, I have to be even better.  
Get closer to more efficient work.
