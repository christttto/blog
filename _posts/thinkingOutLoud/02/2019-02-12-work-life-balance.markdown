Who am I to say, when I don't even have a job yet.  
  

What I can argue is that the principle can be extended to different aspect.  
For instance, I need to balance the amount of time I allocate to studying and applying.  
My intuition is that if I have something presentable I will be far better off to land interveiw.  
  

Then again, another part of me keeps on saying that there must be a job that I can already qualify for.  
  

Well, for now, I will just focus on studying react.  
I am proud that the number 38 worked, where I needed to demonstrate ability to code using conditional rendering.
