Got the timer to be deployed following instructions.  
https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages  
  

It really is nothing big,  
it barely works, tons of error,  
but first functional application with react by me.  
  
Not something I followed instruction for, from bottom to top, I made it.  
  
I think I can be happy for that much.  
  

So I have it sort of working, should now work on something else I feel like.  
  1. portfolio
  2. apply online
  3. leetcode
  4. timer  

Not sure.
