There was another career fair at smaller scale.  
After the fair, a seminar by lawyer on visa.  
What comes down to, is that I would want to start soon.  
I realized that I will be getting the card anytime now.  
  

I would want a transaction that proves that I was working.  
  

That being said, it is really essential that I have a react project right now.  
  

Got up to 34 of the cirriculum, where I got through the major project of todo application.  
This one had lots of parts to understand, where I still have to study more on, but because learning more and being exposed longer will also help with understanding, I am going forward.  
  
Hope to get more done today!
