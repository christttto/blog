Had an interview scheduled this morning, which took a rather interesting route.  
The interviewer knew that I had a flight to catch, so he just straight offered an on-site interview, passing straight through.  
Well, but without a sign-up link sent to my email address.  
My guess is he just has not yet sorted through the interview result.  
Well, I hope.  
  


While on my way to LA, had chance to watch Isle of Dogs, and I have to say, good art always inspires me.  
Inspires me to work, oddly.
