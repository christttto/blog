Got email from USCIS that the EAD Card is on its way.  
So thankful it finally got through.  
Went to a career fair by a company on campus and have to go to a follow up later.  
  

The biggest pitch I can have will be showing how passionate and willing to learn.  
Keep it professional, keep it short.  

Oh, also finished applying to the companies I talked to at the career fair.  
Will bo now going through the index of the career fair.
