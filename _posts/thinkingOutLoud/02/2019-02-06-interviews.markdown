Got email from USCIS that the EAD Card is on its way.  
So thankful it finally got through.  
Went to a career fair by a company on campus and have to go to a follow up later.  
  

The biggest pitch I can have will be showing how passionate and willing to learn.  
Keep it professional, keep it short.
