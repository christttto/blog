So, submitting 150 applications on linkedin had an impact.  
Even though most were dead ends, there were some leads I can take.  
Hopefully they can become something permanent.  
React's form portion of cirriculum is pretty big, as they are farily new to me.  
Another challenge is that I am not as familiar to forms of HTML, which the cirriculum sometimes assume.  
  
I'll continue to stare at the course.  
  

Not sure why, but today feels very dreamy. I am awake, but feels very flowy.  
Studying react's form aspect, still hard to get used to. Practice will make it better.
