I am tricking myself that I am being productive.  
It really doesn't matter that I have something committed on github, unless they mean something.  
What I have committed, useless.  
I need to stop my justification.  

What can I be doing for an hour?  
1. leetcode
2. portfolio page
3. sketch setup
4. application
