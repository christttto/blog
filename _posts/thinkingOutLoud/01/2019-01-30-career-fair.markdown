Career fair hosted by school today.   
Hopefully I will be able to present myself well to the recruiters.  
  


Before going to the career fair, got some work done.  
It may not be much, but I should be proud that I managed to be productive, stay alert.  
Keeping momentum will result better. One hundred percent sure.  
Staying positive, keep moving.
