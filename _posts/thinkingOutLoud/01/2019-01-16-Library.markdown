Talking to recruiters and third party recruiters.  
It feels like I really don't know my value.  
Puts me to think about how much I am worth.  
Very self-centered thoughts I have to say.  
  

More applications submitted, will have to see where it will take us.

AAAnd, it is 11. Did not get enough done.  
I will stay up later today to do more work.
