Well, did a phone screening at the library.  
It was for a company in SD, which sounded pretty cool.  
To be honest and straight up, I do not thint they will hire me.  
Just because I need sponsorship and they are just too small.  
  

No harsh feelings, becuase I know where I stand.  
I learned a lot from the interview, and that is all good for now.  
I still have to learn and keep on trying.  
I have to keep moving.  
Of course I will fail.  
I am moving, and that is more important.  
The movement, the velocity, that's what matters.
