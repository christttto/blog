Had a coding challenge.  
I got it to work, but the type conversion in Java ate up my time to optimize.  
As a result, I passed 6/10 tests, and of the 4 tests I failed, three were for timeout.  
It is frustrating because if I got conversion working, it would have passed all the tests.  
What I can be positive about, is that I got it work.  
When I first read the problem, I did not think I could solve the problem.  
It looked too hard, but I got to pass the basic test.  
It is a lesson for me.  
  
Oh, another video filmed. I will work on it tomorrow at the library.  
Will have to take my external, and pin to take out the sd card.
