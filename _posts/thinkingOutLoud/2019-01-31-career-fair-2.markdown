oh well.  
too busy of day.  
hope I did well today.  
  
I'm cheating on everyday commit challenge because I was just so busy today.  
but actually busy, with not much time to sit down, because of all the career fair and other obligation.  
I feel like this is an okay occasion to be making edit to keep the attendance.  
Have an interview tomorrow, should be getting prepared for!
