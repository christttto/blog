layout: post

testest.  
the generated blog had interesting error where I showed two rows of 1/28 post, and the first was empty.  
Later found out that layout: post must have a space in between for markdown processor to understand.  
So I thought I fixed everything, but turns out one of the post (1/21) did not have that fixed.  
As a result, for some reason, the 1/28 post showed two rows.  
The way I approached to fix the issue was with chrome devtool.  
I did not think it would find the problem directly, but at least, I could see the generated html that could give me a lead.  
  

Lesson learned is that I should go watch how my post has been generated, and always be thankful of the power of good devtool. yee.


So here is me typing on actual 29th, and it can be concluded that I cannot do any work at home.  
Sad to say, but that is the truth, and I have to have to stay outside to get any work done.  
못한다. 집에서는.  
  

이것저것 하다보면 실제로 내가 공부하고 싶은것들을 위한 시간은 많이 남지 않게 되는듯하다. 내 시간관리 + 딴짓안하기!!
