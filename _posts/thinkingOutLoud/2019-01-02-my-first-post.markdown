layout: post
title: This is the custom title from front matter

So this is where I will be posting my progress, in less casual way.
following tutorial by giraffe academy.
front matter is basically head tag of markdown, where I am keeping css type of information.
if I make _drafts directory at the same level as _posts, can have physical file, but not public on the website.
