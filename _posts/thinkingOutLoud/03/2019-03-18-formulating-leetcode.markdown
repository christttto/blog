Do a problem, understand my process.  
By that, I mean to formulate my process.  
It is far better and efficient to be approaching problem in steps.  
Of course, a master would be able to straight dive in, but I would want to focus improving for now.  
  

1. Come up with a brute-force solution  
2. Think of a simpler version of the problem  
3. Think with simpler examples -> try noticing a pattern  
4. Use some visualization  
5. Test your solution on a few examples
