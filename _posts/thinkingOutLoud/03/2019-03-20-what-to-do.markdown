Going through more leetcode problems.  
I think I had some improvements in terms approaching the problem.  
Think of naive way of solving the problem.  
Try to notice a pattern.  
Think about easier cases, make abstraction.  
For easier cases, see how it can be simplified.  
Overcome!  
  
As for hackathon goes, I will keep working on the project.
