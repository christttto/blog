Started to read cracking the coding interview.  
Will try to cover most of the book within 3 weeks.  
  

More coding challenges let me realize how I lack in approaching the problems.  
Hopefully this will help in some way for me to improve.  
  

Got the develop page of my portfolio up and running. Little celebration on that.  
More I code, makes me realize how some portion does not line up well, making me want to work on it more.  
At the same time, moments of realization occur where I know that the problem I am trying to solve should not be prioritized.  

Move on.  
Work on.
