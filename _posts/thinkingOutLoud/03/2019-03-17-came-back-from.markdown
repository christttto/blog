Came back from doing an on-site interview.  
It was a good experience where I got to see where I needed to improve.  
  

Little more on self-critique:  
1. Takes too long to turn logic into code.  
2. Having general idea should not be good enough.  
	I have to be specific and fast-formulating.  
3. Need to create almost a chart, that I can follow to optimize.  
  

I think the biggest problem is, I solve a question.  
But there is no retaining the knowledge.  
I have to remember how I got to the answer, formulated.
