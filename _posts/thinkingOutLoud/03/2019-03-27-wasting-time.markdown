Time being very essential to me, I have been wasting too much time. I really have to stay productive. Up and running.  
Learning SASS.
So main.scss file will help me to organize.  
It will be rendered into main.css that will work with all css at once.  
So work with the mobile section first, and with the resource made for it, create the desktop implementation.
