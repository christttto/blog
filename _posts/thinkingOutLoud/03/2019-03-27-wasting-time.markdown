Time being very essential to me, I have been wasting too much time. I really have to stay productive. Up and running.  
Learning SASS.
So main.scss file will help me to organize.  
It will be rendered into main.css that will work with all css at once.  
So work with the mobile section first, and with the resource made for it, create the desktop implementation.  
Function in SASS. they are functions for me to use.  
Define name, parameter, return something.  
What I understand is that I can create nested properties and the real-time sass interpreter will generate css file for me.  
CSS also has function ability that allows me to create custom function.  
In case of window size, it allows me to create breakpoint to get the margin issue working.  
I still have to understand how font size like em works.
