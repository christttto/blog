Testing cannot be done perfectly, cannot test every aspect.  
	it will increase exponentially.  
Decide what will be more important, and invest accordingly.  
Early testing.
	Testing starts as early as possible in software development life cycle.  
Testing is context dependent
  


1. Testing shows presence of defects  
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible  
3. Early testing  
4. Defect Clustering  
5. Pesticide Paradox  
6. Testing is context dependent  
7. Absence of errors - fallacy  
  
  
Requirements gathering stage = Gather as much information
design = plan the programing lanugage
build = actually code
test = test  
  
  
4 stages(5 with maintainence)  
The waterfall method.  
Half of defects are made in earlier cycle.  
  

V-model of testing  
For every stage, dedicated software testing.  
  
SDLC STLC  
  

Iterative life cycle.  
With each phase, has mini waterfall method.
