Why use node?  
Highly scalabe because event driven, non-blocking i/o model  
Same language on the front and back end(JS)  
  

Works on a single thread using non-blocking i/o calls  
	php would be synchronous where a thread will have to wait till request finishes.  
	Can max out on the machine memory.  
The single thread can handle more.  
Would not want to use with cpu heavy calculation.  
  

Fires an event, let it add to eventloop and moves on.
