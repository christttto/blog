Got too carried out from this.  
It is hard to stay focused, I must admit.  
Empty the thoughts, keep on trying.  
Skipped several days on practicing and learning.  
Which is terribl.  
I am filling up now. But Really, it is something I am not hiding.  
Made a decision to have a simple whole application up and running.  
Not sure what I want to create.  
It will be hard, I will have to learn a lot.  
But, it will prove how I am worth investment.  
It will be a good replacement for the project section of the resume.  
I will make react native for both mobile and web application!  
Oh, last date change for Friday.
