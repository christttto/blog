Turned down three interviews this week.  
Seemed too far off from what I want to be doing.  
Thought if I wanted to, I could explore something like this in the near future, when I run out of options.  
Not too soon.  
When I have to, I will.  


What can I do today.  
1. React
2. Convolutional Neural Network
3. portfolio
4. linkedin
